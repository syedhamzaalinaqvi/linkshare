It sounds like your project on Vercel is returning JSON data instead of rendering the frontend, which could be caused by a few reasons. Here’s a checklist of things you might want to check to ensure your project is set up correctly:

### 1. **Check the Build and Output Configuration:**
   - **Ensure that your build process is correct**: If you're using frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, or others, make sure that the build command is correctly specified in your Vercel settings. For example:
     - For **Next.js**: the default build command is `next build` and the output directory is `.next/`.
     - For **React** (with Create React App): the default build command is `react-scripts build`, and the output directory is `build/`.
   - **Set the right output directory**: In Vercel’s project settings, ensure that the output directory is set correctly. For React or Next.js, this will typically be `build/` or `.next/`.

### 2. **Check Your Routes and API Responses:**
   - If you are using **API routes** in Next.js or any other framework, ensure that your main routes (e.g., `/`, `/home`, `/about`) are properly defined to render the frontend rather than returning JSON data. JSON responses are typically returned from API endpoints, not the main pages.
   
   - If you're using **static site generation** (SSG) or **server-side rendering** (SSR), make sure the pages are being rendered correctly.

### 3. **Verify the Frontend is Building Correctly:**
   - Check the build logs on Vercel to make sure the frontend is being built correctly without errors. Look for any failed build steps or missing files that could prevent the proper frontend from being served.

### 4. **Look at Your `vercel.json` Configuration:**
   - If you have a `vercel.json` file in your project, make sure it's configured correctly. This file can control how your app is built, how redirects work, and where files are deployed. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "builds": [
         {
           "src": "index.html",
           "use": "@vercel/static"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### 5. **Check for a Mismatch Between Static and API Routes:**
   - If your frontend is intended to serve static files, make sure you're not accidentally using API endpoints to serve frontend pages, which would return data in JSON format. A static hosting approach should serve HTML files, not JSON data.

### 6. **Review the Content-Type Header:**
   - Sometimes, the response may be incorrectly interpreted by the browser because of the `Content-Type` header. If Vercel is returning JSON instead of HTML, check the headers to ensure the `Content-Type` is `text/html` when rendering frontend pages.

### 7. **Consider Other Hosting Options (If Necessary):**
   - If you don't need dynamic features like server-side rendering, **static hosting** on Vercel should work fine.
   - If your project uses backend features (like APIs or server-side logic), ensure that you have configured the backend properly, or consider hosting it elsewhere like on **Heroku**, **Netlify**, or **AWS** for more complex setups.
